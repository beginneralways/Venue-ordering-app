1. Introduction 
In recent years, the rapid advancements in technology have revolutionized various industries, and the food sector is no exception. With the increasing preference for convenience and efficiency, traditional bakery businesses have embraced digital solutions to streamline their operations and enhance customer experiences. As part of my internship, I had the invaluable opportunity to work on a web application for a bakery ordering system, powered by Node.js—a powerful and versatile server-side JavaScript runtime environment.

The aim of this internship project was to create a robust, user-friendly, and scalable web application that simplifies the ordering process for customers while optimizing the bakery's internal processes. By leveraging the capabilities of Node.js, we set out to build a dynamic platform that not only facilitates smooth online orders but also enables real-time updates and inventory management, ultimately enhancing the bakery's productivity and customer satisfaction.

In this report, I will present a comprehensive overview of the internship project, detailing the goals, technologies used, challenges encountered, and the solutions devised. Furthermore, I will outline my contributions to the development process, demonstrating the skills and knowledge acquired during the internship.


2. Problem Statement
The manual system is unable to keep whole record of customers and product and sales in bakery. There is a lot of chances of mistakes and miscalculation of expenses and profits. So, this all consumes a lot of time of users and lot of paperwork to handled.
Bakery doesn’t have any proper recording system where they store their data, they use to save their data on register or paper which can be lost or misplace easily.
Bakery do not have the automatic way of generated bills. All the bills were manually made there is lot of chance of mistake in calculating the data.

ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

Bakery management should increase an employment for faster services.
Create a website for online services like orderings; cakes, cookies, breads, etc





3. Objectives
The primary objective of this internship project was to gain hands-on experience with the Node.js runtime environment and to develop a functional web application for a bakery ordering system. Specifically, the objectives of the project were as follows:

>> Understanding Node.js Fundamentals: Acquiring a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of Node.js, including event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O, and the benefits of using JavaScript on the server-side.

>> Utilizing npm Ecosystem: Familiarizing myself with the vast npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem and leveraging relevant packages and modules to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the application.

>> Working with Express.js: Gaining hands-on experience with Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, to streamline the development process and ensure efficient routing and middleware handling

>> Database Integration: Integrating a database (e.g., MongoDB) with Node.js to store and manage customer information, order details, and bakery inventory.

>> User Authentication and Security (eg, json web token ,bcrypt js): Implementing secure user authentication mechanisms using Node.js and ensuring that sensitive data remains protected through encryption and best security practices.

>> Creating RESTful APIs: Designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Node.js to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the bakery ordering system.

>> Building a Robust Backend: Developing a robust backend for the web application using Node.js to handle various functionalities such as user authentication, order processing, and database interactions.
